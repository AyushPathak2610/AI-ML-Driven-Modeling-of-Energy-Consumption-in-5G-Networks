<p>The <strong>5G network</strong>, while more energy-efficient than its predecessor, still faces significant energy consumption challenges, particularly in the <strong>radio access network (RAN)</strong>, specifically the <em>base stations</em>. Over <strong>70%</strong> of the total energy consumption is attributed to this component. To mitigate this issue, the paper underscores the importance of optimizing <strong>base station parameters</strong> and implementing energy-saving techniques. Key factors influencing energy consumption include <strong>architectural design</strong>, <strong>configuration settings</strong>, <strong>traffic patterns</strong>, and <strong>energy-saving strategies</strong>. Accurate energy consumption modeling is essential for efficient network deployments. The paper concludes by proposing an <strong>AI challenge</strong> focused on developing a <strong>machine learning-based solution</strong> to enhance the energy efficiency of 5G networks.</p>
